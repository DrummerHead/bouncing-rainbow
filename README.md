# Bouncing Rainbow

## Technology

Bouncing Rainbow was done with [Processing](http://www.processing.org/) and ported using [Processing.js](http://processingjs.org/)

Music through HTML5 Audio element with audio codec compatibility detection before injection.

Simple audio player with jQuery.

## Music

Song 'Dennye' from the album 'Safafa' by [Jellica](http://www.8bitpeoples.com/discography/by/jellica)

## Inspiration

[Demoscene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene)

## Notice

If you fork this you will also need a folder at root called 'audio' and inside it this song: http://mcdlr.com/bouncing-rainbow/audio/8bp123-01-jellica-dennye.mp3

If you don't see the player is because the client doesn't support mp3 format, yelp!
